# CMSC320 Final Project

## An analysis of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive pro matches from 2015-2020

Contributors: Angelo Parker, Bailey Jones, Jiho Lee, Chris Duong

We want to create an extensive look at pro CSGO matches from the "golden age" of CS:GO, from 2015-2020, with data scraped from HLTV.com and posted on Kaggle.

Note: players.csv too large to add to GitHub, recommended to download from Kaggle and work locally.
